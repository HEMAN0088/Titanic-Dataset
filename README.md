# Titanic-Dataset
Machine Learning project to predict survival on the Titanic using classification models, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.

# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to analyze passenger data from the Titanic disaster and build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger would survive or not.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using data such as age, sex, class, fare, and family connections onboard.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 891 rows and 12 columns, with key features such as:
- `Pclass`: Ticket class
- `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`
- `Fare`, `Embarked`
- Target variable: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
